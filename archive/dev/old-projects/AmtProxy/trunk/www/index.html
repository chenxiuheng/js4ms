<h1>AMT RTSP Proxy Server</h1>
The AMT RTSP Proxy Server can be started as an independent process via Java Web Start.
Once the server has been started, RTSP clients can use it to access a multicast
streaming media presentation. The proxy server listens for RTSP requests on port 8054.
The HTTP URL for an SDP description for a stream must be passed as the query string
value in the RTSP URL. For example:
<p>
<code style="color:green">rtsp://127.0.0.1:8054/?&lt;sdp-url&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
On Windows, Java Web Start will start a windowless process with the name 
"javaws.exe". At present, it can only be stopped by killing the process 
directly. On Mac OS X, the server will run as a minimal application with
a menu that can be used to stop it.
</p>
<p>
The proxy server does not accept SDP descriptions for unicast 
presentations. The connection records in the SDP must specify multicast 
addresses and any SDP description that contains an SSM connection 
address must include a source-filter attribute record that applies to 
that address. The proxy server can only fetch SDP descriptions using 
from an http: URL - it cannot yet act as an RTSP client to fetch SDP 
descriptions from another RTSP server.
</p>
<p>
Click on the button below to launch an instance of the proxy server.<br>
</p>
<p>
<script>
    var anchor = document.createElement("a");
    anchor.href = "AmtProxy.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(anchor.href, "1.6+");
</script>
</p>
<p>
Note: The server will fail to start if another server instance is already running,
including one started by a running applet.
</p>
<p>
Sample SDP files can be found <a href="/SDPs">here</a>.
The SDP files configured for AMT are organized by AMT relay address.
</p>
<p>
To play the streams described by the SDP files, start the appropriate media player and
select the menu option for opening a URL. Copy the link location of the desired SDP
file and append it to the local host RTSP URL for the proxy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<code id="url" style="color:green"></code>
</blockquote>
<script>
anchor = document.createElement("a");
anchor.href = "/SDPs/SSM-AMT/172.18.175.175/BBC2.sdp";
document.getElementById("url").innerHTML = "rtsp://127.0.0.1:8054/?" + anchor.href
</script>
<p>
If using VLC, you can also use a play list (.xspf file) to identify multiple streams for playout.
Select the menu option to open a FILE or URL. Enter the file path or HTTP url for an .xspf file:
</p>
<blockquote>
<code id="playlist" style="color:green"></code>
</blockquote>
<script>
anchor = document.createElement("a");
anchor.href = "/SDPs/SSM-AMT/172.18.175.175/playlist.xspf";
document.getElementById("playlist").innerHTML = anchor.href
</script>
Once the play list is loaded, the <b>|&lt;&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;&gt;|</b> buttons to switch between streams.

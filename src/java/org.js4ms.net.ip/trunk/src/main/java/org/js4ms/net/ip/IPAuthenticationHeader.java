/**
 * An IP authentication header.
 * See <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2402">[RFC-2402]</a>
 * <p>
 * The protocol header (IPv4, IPv6, or Extension) immediately preceding the AH header will
 * contain the value 51 in its Protocol (IPv4) or Next Header (IPv6, Extension) field
 * [STD-2].

 * The following subsections define the fields that comprise the AH format. All the fields
 * described here are mandatory, i.e., they are always present in the AH format and are
 * included in the Integrity Check Value (ICV) computation (see Sections 2.6 and 3.3.3).
 * <p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt><u>Next Header</u>
 * <dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>The Next Header is an 8-bit field that identifies the type of the next payload
 * after the Authentication Header. The value of this field is chosen from the set of IP
 * Protocol Numbers defined in the most recent "Assigned Numbers" [STD-2] RFC from the
 * Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</dd>
 * <p>
 * <dt><u>Payload Length</u>
 * <dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>This 8-bit field specifies the length of AH in 32-bit words (4-byte units), minus
 * "2". (All IPv6 extension headers, as per RFC 1883, encode the "Hdr Ext Len" field by
 * first subtracting 1 (64-bit word) from the header length (measured in 64-bit words). AH
 * is an IPv6 extension header. However, since its length is measured in 32-bit words, the
 * "Payload Length" is calculated by subtracting 2 (32 bit words).) In the "standard" case
 * of a 96-bit authentication value plus the 3 32-bit word fixed portion, this length
 * field will be "4". A "null" authentication algorithm may be used only for debugging
 * purposes. Its use would result in a "1" value for this field for IPv4 or a "2" for
 * IPv6, as there would be no corresponding Authentication Data field (see Section
 * 3.3.3.2.1 on "Authentication Data Padding").</dd>
 * <p>
 * <dt><u>Reserved</u>
 * <dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>This 16-bit field is reserved for future use. It MUST be set to "zero." (Note that
 * the value is included in the Authentication Data calculation, but is otherwise ignored
 * by the recipient.)</dd>
 * <p>
 * <dt><u>Security Parameters Index (SPI)</u>
 * <dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>The SPI is an arbitrary 32-bit value that, in combination with the destination IP
 * address and security protocol (AH), uniquely identifies the Security Association for
 * this datagram. The set of SPI values in the range 1 through 255 are reserved by the
 * Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for future use; a reserved SPI value will
 * not normally be assigned by IANA unless the use of the assigned SPI value is specified
 * in an RFC. It is ordinarily selected by the destination system upon establishment of an
 * SA (see the Security Architecture document for more details).
 * <p>
 * The SPI value of zero (0) is reserved for local, implementation- specific use and MUST
 * NOT be sent on the wire. For example, a key management implementation MAY use the zero
 * SPI value to mean "No Security Association Exists" during the period when the IPsec
 * implementation has requested that its key management entity establish a new SA, but the
 * SA has not yet been established.</dd>
 * <p>
 * <dt><u>Sequence Number</u>
 * <dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>This unsigned 32-bit field contains a monotonically increasing counter value
 * (sequence number). It is mandatory and is always present even if the receiver does not
 * elect to enable the anti-replay service for a specific SA. Processing of the Sequence
 * Number field is at the discretion of the receiver, i.e., the sender MUST always
 * transmit this field, but the receiver need not act upon it (see the discussion of
 * Sequence Number Verification in the "Inbound Packet Processing" section below).
 * <p>
 * The sender's counter and the receiver's counter are initialized to 0 when an SA is
 * established. (The first packet sent using a given SA will have a Sequence Number of 1;
 * see Section 3.3.2 for more details on how the Sequence Number is generated.) If
 * anti-replay is enabled (the default), the transmitted Sequence Number must never be
 * allowed to cycle. Thus, the sender's counter and the receiver's counter MUST be reset
 * (by establishing a new SA and thus a new key) prior to the transmission of the 2^32nd
 * packet on an SA.</dd>
 * <p>
 * <dt><u>Authentication Data</u>
 * <dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>This is a variable-length field that contains the Integrity Check Value (ICV) for
 * this packet. The field must be an integral multiple of 32 bits in length. The details
 * of the ICV computation are described in Section 3.3.2 below. This field may include
 * explicit padding. This padding is included to ensure that the length of the AH header
 * is an integral multiple of 32 bits (IPv4) or 64 bits (IPv6). All implementations MUST
 * support such padding. Details of how to compute the required padding length are
 * provided below. The authentication algorithm specification MUST specify the length of
 * the ICV and the comparison rules and processing steps for validation.</dd>
 * <p>

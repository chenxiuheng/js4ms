h2. Introduction

There are a number of application areas that are ideal candidates for the use of multicast, including media broadcasting, video conferencing, collaboration, real-time data feeds, data replication, and software updates.  Unfortunately, many of these applications lack multicast connectivity to networks that carry traffic generated by multicast sources.  The reasons for the lack of connectivity vary, but are primarily the result of service provider policies and network limitations.

Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT) is a protocol that uses UDP-based encapsulation to overcome the aforementioned lack of multicast connectivity.  AMT enables sites, hosts or applications that do not have native multicast access to a network with multicast connectivity to a source, to request and receive SSM \[[RFC4607|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4607]\] and ASM \[[RFC1112|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1112]\] traffic from a network that does provide multicast connectivity to that source.

h2. General Architecture

The AMT protocol employs a client-server model in which a "gateway" sends requests to receive specific multicast traffic to a "relay" which responds by delivering the requested multicast traffic back to the gateway.

Gateways are generally deployed within networks that lack multicast support or lack connectivity to a multicast-enabled network containing multicast sources of interest.
Relays are deployed within multicast-enabled networks that contain, or have connectivity to, multicast sources.

AMT relies on the Internet Group Management (IGMP) \[[RFC3376|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3376]\] and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) \[[RFC3810|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3810]\] protocols to provide the functionality required to manage, communicate, and act on changes in multicast group membership.

 * <blockquote> *If included in the Payload field, cryptographic synchronization data,
 * e.g., an Initialization Vector (IV, see Section 2.3), usually is not encrypted per se,
 * although it often is referred to as being part of the ciphertext. </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * In the following field descriptions "Optional" means that
 * the field is omitted if the option is not selected, i.e., it is present in neither the
 * packet as transmitted nor as formatted for computation of an Integrity Check Value
 * (ICV, see Section 2.7). Whether or not an option is selected is defined as part of
 * Security Association (SA) establishment. Thus the format of ESP packets for a given SA
 * is fixed, for the duration of the SA. In contrast, "mandatory" fields are always
 * present in the ESP packet format, for all SAs.
 * <dl>
 * <dt><u>Security Parameters Index</u></dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>The SPI is an arbitrary 32-bit value that, in combination with the destination IP
 * address and security protocol (ESP), uniquely identifies the Security Association for
 * this datagram. The set of SPI values in the range 1 through 255 are reserved by the
 * Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for future use; a reserved SPI value will
 * not normally be assigned by IANA unless the use of the assigned SPI value is specified
 * in an RFC. It is ordinarily selected by the destination system upon establishment of an
 * SA (see the Security Architecture document for more details). The SPI field is
 * mandatory.
 * <p>
 * The SPI value of zero (0) is reserved for local, implementation- specific use and MUST
 * NOT be sent on the wire. For example, a key management implementation MAY use the zero
 * SPI value to mean "No Security Association Exists" during the period when the IPsec
 * implementation has requested that its key management entity establish a new SA, but the
 * SA has not yet been established.</dd>
 * <p>
 * <dt><u>Sequence Number</u></dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>This unsigned 32-bit field contains a monotonically increasing counter value
 * (sequence number). It is mandatory and is always present even if the receiver does not
 * elect to enable the anti-replay service for a specific SA. Processing of the Sequence
 * Number field is at the discretion of the receiver, i.e., the sender MUST always
 * transmit this field, but the receiver need not act upon it (see the discussion of
 * Sequence Number Verification in the "Inbound Packet Processing" section below).
 * <p>
 * The sender's counter and the receiver's counter are initialized to 0 when an SA is
 * established. (The first packet sent using a given SA will have a Sequence Number of 1;
 * see Section 3.3.3 for more details on how the Sequence Number is generated.) If
 * anti-replay is enabled (the default), the transmitted Sequence Number must never be
 * allowed to cycle. Thus, the sender's counter and the receiver's counter MUST be reset
 * (by establishing a new SA and thus a new key) prior to the transmission of the 2^32nd
 * packet on an SA.</dd>
 * <p>
 * <dt><u>Payload Data</u></dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>Payload Data is a variable-length field containing data described by the Next
 * Header field. The Payload Data field is mandatory and is an integral number of bytes in
 * length. If the algorithm used to encrypt the payload requires cryptographic
 * synchronization data, e.g., an Initialization Vector (IV), then this data MAY be
 * carried explicitly in the Payload field. Any encryption algorithm that requires such
 * explicit, per-packet synchronization data MUST indicate the length, any structure for
 * such data, and the location of this data as part of an RFC specifying how the algorithm
 * is used with ESP. If such synchronization data is implicit, the algorithm for deriving
 * the data MUST be part of the RFC.
 * <p>
 * Note that with regard to ensuring the alignment of the (real) ciphertext in the
 * presence of an IV:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>For some IV-based modes of operation, the receiver treats the IV as the start of
 * the ciphertext, feeding it into the algorithm directly. In these modes, alignment of
 * the start of the (real) ciphertext is not an issue at the receiver.
 * <li>In some cases, the receiver reads the IV in separately from the ciphertext. In
 * these cases, the algorithm specification MUST address how alignment of the (real)
 * ciphertext is to be achieved.
 * </ul>
 * </dd>
 * <dt><u>Padding (for Encryption)</u></dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>Several factors require or motivate use of the Padding field.
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If an encryption algorithm is employed that requires the plaintext to be a multiple
 * of some number of bytes, e.g., the block size of a block cipher, the Padding field is
 * used to fill the plaintext (consisting of the Payload Data, Pad Length and Next Header
 * fields, as well as the Padding) to the size required by the algorithm.
 * <li>Padding also may be required, irrespective of encryption algorithm requirements, to
 * ensure that the resulting ciphertext terminates on a 4-byte boundary. Specifically, the
 * Pad Length and Next Header fields must be right aligned within a 4-byte word, as
 * illustrated in the ESP packet format figure above, to ensure that the Authentication
 * Data field (if present) is aligned on a 4-byte boundary.
 * <li>Padding beyond that required for the algorithm or alignment reasons cited above,
 * may be used to conceal the actual length of the payload, in support of (partial)
 * traffic flow confidentiality. However, inclusion of such additional padding has adverse
 * bandwidth implications and thus its use should be undertaken with care.
 * </ul>
 * The sender MAY add 0-255 bytes of padding. Inclusion of the Padding field in an ESP
 * packet is optional, but all implementations MUST support generation and consumption of
 * padding.
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>For the purpose of ensuring that the bits to be encrypted are a multiple of the
 * algorithm's blocksize (first bullet above), the padding computation applies to the
 * Payload Data exclusive of the IV, the Pad Length, and Next Header fields.
 * <li>For the purposes of ensuring that the Authentication Data is aligned on a 4-byte
 * boundary (second bullet above), the padding computation applies to the Payload Data
 * inclusive of the IV, the Pad Length, and Next Header fields.
 * </ul>
 * If Padding bytes are needed but the encryption algorithm does not specify the padding
 * contents, then the following default processing MUST be used. The Padding bytes are
 * initialized with a series of (unsigned, 1-byte) integer values. The first padding byte
 * appended to the plaintext is numbered 1, with subsequent padding bytes making up a
 * monotonically increasing sequence: 1, 2, 3, ... When this padding scheme is employed,
 * the receiver SHOULD inspect the Padding field. (This scheme was selected because of its
 * relative simplicity, ease of implementation in hardware, and because it offers limited
 * protection against certain forms of "cut and paste" attacks in the absence of other
 * integrity measures, if the receiver checks the padding values upon decryption.)
 * <p>
 * Any encryption algorithm that requires Padding other than the default described above,
 * MUST define the Padding contents (e.g., zeros or random data) and any required receiver
 * processing of these Padding bytes in an RFC specifying how the algorithm is used with
 * ESP. In such circumstances, the content of the Padding field will be determined by the
 * encryption algorithm and mode selected and defined in the corresponding algorithm RFC.
 * The relevant algorithm RFC MAY specify that a receiver MUST inspect the Padding field
 * or that a receiver MUST inform senders of how the receiver will handle the Padding
 * field.</dd>
 * <p>
 * <dt><u>Pad Length</u></dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>The Pad Length field indicates the number of pad bytes immediately preceding it.
 * The range of valid values is 0-255, where a value of zero indicates that no Padding
 * bytes are present. The Pad Length field is mandatory.</dd>
 * <p>
 * <dt><u>Next Header</u></dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>The Next Header is an 8-bit field that identifies the type of data contained in the
 * Payload Data field, e.g., an extension header in IPv6 or an upper layer protocol
 * identifier. The value of this field is chosen from the set of IP Protocol Numbers
 * defined in the most recent "Assigned Numbers" [STD-2] RFC from the Internet Assigned
 * Numbers Authority (IANA). The Next Header field is mandatory.</dd>
 * <p>
 * <dt><u>Authentication Data</u></dt>
 * <p>
 * <dd>The Authentication Data is a variable-length field containing an Integrity Check
 * Value (ICV) computed over the ESP packet minus the Authentication Data. The length of
 * the field is specified by the authentication function selected. The Authentication Data
 * field is optional, and is included only if the authentication service has been selected
 * for the SA in question. The authentication algorithm specification MUST specify the
 * length of the ICV and the comparison rules and processing steps for validation.</dd>
